     <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly of the ecosphere or the
        universe as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena 
        of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or
        humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior 
        to nature.During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature
        became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.With the Industrial
        revolution, nature

     <p>Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife.
         Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to 
         the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things 
         exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is 
         often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, 
         and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, 
         or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human 
         interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example,
          "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things
           that can still be found to

    <h2>section three</h2> 
     <p>The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word 
        natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant
        "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek 
        word physis  which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals,
        and other features of the world to develop of their own accord. The concept of nature as a 
        whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;it began
        with certain core applications of the word  by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word
        had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.

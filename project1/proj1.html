         <h2>A millionaire Technologist business leader & philantropist </h2>

              He also enjoys bridge, tennis and golf. His days are planned for him on a minute-by-minute basis, similarly to the 
              U.S. president's schedule.Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates flew coach (economy class) 
              in commercial aircraft until 1997, when he bought a private jet. Gates purchased the Codex Leicester, a collection 
              of scientific writings by Leonardo da Vinci, for US$30.8 million at an auction in 1994. In 1998, he reportedly 
              paid $30 million for the original 1885 maritime painting Lost on the Grand Banks, at the time a record price for an 
              American painting. In 2016, he revealed that he was color-blind. On May 10, 2022, Gates said that he tested
              positive for COVID-19 and was experiencing mild symptoms. Gates has received three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

         <ul>
            <li><p>Early life & education:</p>
                William Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington as the only son of William H.
                Gates Sr.[b] (1925-2020) and his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates (1929-1994).His ancestry includes English,
                German, and Irish/Scots-Irish. His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of
                directors of First Interstate BancSystem and United Way of America
            </li>
            <li><p>College career and the foundation of microsoft:</p>
                He was a freshman at Hadvard University in 1973.
                He left Harvard to make software. Bill Gates saw an opportunity to transform the personal computer, which was expensive and difficult to use.
                In 2006, Gates announced he was going to quit his job at Microsoft. This was so he could do more charity work 
                with his wife, Melinda. Their charity is called the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
             </li>
            <li><p>Networth:</p>
                n 1986, Gates took Microsoft public. The company's stock was worth $520 million. Gates
                owned 45 percent of the stock himself, which was worth $234 million. The company continued its rapid growth
                and the stock price soared. At one point, Gates' stock was worth over $100 billion.

                company's history was as a manager and executive. He has not officially been on a 
                development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[63] but he wrote code that 
                shipped with the company's products as late as 1989.
